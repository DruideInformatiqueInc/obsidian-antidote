This folder contains source of the client of the WebSocket API, provided by [Druide](https://www.druide.com/) (the company behind [Antidote](https://www.antidote.info/)).

The code is adapted to Obsidian API, and the communication between this plugin and the Connectix agent, is based on the communication designed into the VS Code Antidote extension, created by Druide.
